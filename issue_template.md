Expected behavior and actual behavior:
side: Order
Character name : Belgravia
BUG: My characters shows up normal for me but others see me clothless and with huge chain and a massive mine crossing the screen.
No other character I have is showing this issu. It seems to be only Belgravia that has this bug. I last played her a week ago (nov 27) and again tonight and the same bug appeared. Relogging didn't change anything. I haven't found anything in the forums regarding a large ball and chain. I am now getting tells to relog or i am asked what trincket does this. I would appreciate your help in this matter. Thank you, Belgravia.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
I don't know how it showed up. I was in Dragonwake when the ball and chain appeared and it stuck to me...
