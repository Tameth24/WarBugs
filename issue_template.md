Expected behavior and actual behavior:
side: Order
Character name : Belgravia
BUG: My characters shows up normal for me but others see me clothless and with huge chain crossing the screen.
No other character i have is showing this issu. It seems to be only Belgravia. I last played her a week ago and again tonight and it is the same issue. I haven't found anything in the forums regarding a large chain. Please help


Steps to reproduce the problem:
I don't know how it showed up. I was in Dragonwake when the chain appeared and it stuck to me...
